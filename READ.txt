Kuki, continue helping me with my **Furniture E-commerce Website** project. 

We’re following the **modular monolith architecture** using **Node.js + Express (ES modules)** and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**.  
We already completed these features:
- User signup (email OTP verification with Nodemailer)
- Email verification
- Login with JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies
- userAuth middleware implemented
-tested userAuth
-Created protected user profile endpoints (GET /profile, PUT /profile, PUT /change-password)
-Implemented logout (POST /logout)

Next steps I want to work on:
 





Please continue using the **same modular structure**:
`controller`, `service`, `routes`, and `model` inside each module.  
We’re using `app.js` and `server.js` separately.  
All code should follow ES module syntax (`import/export`).

Now let’s continue from here:
